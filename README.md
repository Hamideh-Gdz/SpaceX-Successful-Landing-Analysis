# SpaceX-Successful-Landing-Analysis
SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk, is a company focused on space transportation and aerospace manufacturing. One of its most significant achievements is the Falcon 9 rocket, designed for reusability. By landing and reusing the first stage, SpaceX has drastically lowered the cost of space launches. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website for $65 million, while other providers charge upwards of $165 million per launch. Much of these savings come from the ability to reuse the first stage, making space exploration more accessible.
This repository includes notebooks(from data collection to machine learning) for SpaceX's Falcon 9 successful landing analysis.
